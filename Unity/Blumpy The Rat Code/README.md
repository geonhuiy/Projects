# Blumpy The Rat
Game project for studies

Short video game about a rat that teleports and has to run trials for science. 

The video game consist of six challenge rooms and transition screens. In order to complete a room, the player must navigate through the traps, pick up the key and leave through the door.

I order to get past traps and hazards, the player must use the teleport mechanic. This is done by holding down a directional key in one of the four teleport directions. While holding don the key, Lshift is pressed to teleport in chosen direction. While a directional key is held down, time slows down in order to give the player a better chance to react to traps.

Game made in Unity, scripts written in #C
